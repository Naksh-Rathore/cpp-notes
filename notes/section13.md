# Unscoped enumerations

Unscoped enumerations are defined via the `enum` keyword.

Enumerated types are best taught by example, so let’s define an unscoped enumeration that can hold some color values. We’ll explain how it all works below.

Example:

```cpp
// Define a new unscoped enumeration named Color
enum Color
{
    // Here are the enumerators
    // These symbolic constants define all the possible values this type can hold
    // Each enumerator is separated by a comma, not a semicolon
    red,
    green,
    blue, // trailing comma optional but recommended
}; // the enum definition must end with a semicolon

int main()
{
    // Define a few variables of enumerated type Color
    Color apple { red };   // my apple is red
    Color shirt { green }; // my shirt is green
    Color cup { blue };    // my cup is blue

    Color socks { white }; // error: white is not an enumerator of Color
    Color hat { 2 };       // error: 2 is not an enumerator of Color

    return 0;
}
```
# Scoped Enums

Scoped enumerations work similarly to unscoped enumerations, but have two primary differences: They won’t implicitly convert to integers, and the enumerators are only placed into the scope region of the enumeration (not into the scope region where the enumeration is defined). You have to use them like namespaces.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    enum class Color // "enum class" defines this as a scoped enumeration rather than an unscoped enumeration
    {
        red, // red is considered part of Color's scope region
        blue,
    };

    enum class Fruit
    {
        banana, // banana is considered part of Fruit's scope region
        apple,
    };

    Color color { Color::red }; // note: red is not directly accessible, we have to use Color::red
    Fruit fruit { Fruit::banana }; // note: banana is not directly accessible, we have to use Fruit::banana

    if (color == fruit) // compile error: the compiler doesn't know how to compare different types Color and Fruit
        std::cout << "color and fruit are equal\n";
    else
        std::cout << "color and fruit are not equal\n";

    return 0;
}
```
**Prefer enum classes over raw enums unless the latter has a compelling benefit.**
