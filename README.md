## Overview

These are just my personal C++ notes from the website [learncpp.com](https://learncpp.com), with `.md` explanations, simple projects, and a Makefile you can use for your own projects. Feel free to look around, 
copy and use code and explanations from this repository while abiding the license's rules. Some explanations may be missing since I skipped writing the stuff I already knew, but if you really think it would
benefit others if I added it, feel free to submit an issue or pull request.

## Structure

```
C:.
├───notes
├───practice
└───projects
```

* Projects: Simple practice programs like rock paper scissors, tic-tac-toe, a number guessing game, and more!
* Practice: An empty file to write code in and a Makefile to build and test. Perfect for learning the basics
* Notes: A directory that has explanations and guides on how to do things in C++. Each filename corresponds to a section in the [learncpp.com](https://learncpp.com) website. For example, `section1.md` is for the first section in the site.

## Contributing

  Feel free to make an issue, pull request, or contact me at any of my socials to ask me if you want! My issues, pull requests, and DMs are always open. That being said, I would like if the issues and PRs you
  send are **relevant**, **concise**, and are actually **helpful** in general. Spammy and unrelated issues and PRs will either be closed or given the `info-needed` tag. Thanks!
